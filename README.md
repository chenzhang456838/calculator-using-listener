# calculator-using-listener
This is a JAVA and Antrl4 project using Listener.

/************* skip it **************************/

This is a following work when I finished the calculator using Antrl4 Visitor. And I added some semantic checks here that could deal with some invalid input. 

After I finished last project, I got a phone call from the person who gave me this project. He was not satisfied with what I did and told me that he gave this project to several people and what I did is not good. And he asked me to use Listener instead of Visitor and added some semetic checks and type checks. 

I finished this new project in another two days. And I was still confused with his requirments. So I sent him an email to check some detailed requirments and sent him a picture of my current outputs (including some invalid inputs). He just replied me "got it" without answering any of my questions. Then I realized he was still not satisfied. So I gave up continue doing the work (in fact, I didn't know what to do). 

From then, I know, customers can not be satisfied with what you do because they do not know their requirments. Even if they know the requirements, they won't let you know. You should guess.

Except for using visitor to build an calculator, use listener is much better. 

Use the following command to run the project

mvn compile

mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="chen.calc.App"
